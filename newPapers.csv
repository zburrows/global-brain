Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al.,Valuing the functionality of tropical ecosystems beyond carbon,"Aguirre-Gutiérrez, Jesus","Stevens, Nicola",Oxford University (UK),2023,Science & Society,"Tree planting on tropical grasslands (afforestation) is attractive to carbon credit developers due to favourable climatic and topographic conditions that promote rapid plant growth. But tropical ecosystems offer billions of dollars in other ecosystem services -- carbon storage, water provisioning, grazing land, nature-based tourism, and biodiversity conservation. Increasing woody biomass on intact savanna ecosystems generally represents a state of degradation. Carbon-focused tree planting exacerbates biodiversity loss, particularly of species adapted to open environments. For example, in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) a 40% increase in woody cover resulted in a ~30% reduction in the diversity of plants and ants. It also can deplete groundwater, reducing streamflow between 40-80%.","Tree planting in grasslands can offset emissions but risks harming ecosystems.
