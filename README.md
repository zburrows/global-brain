This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

Global Brain is a knowledge management system (KMS) for organizing metadata associated with scientific papers. It supports both document upload and open-access URLs. Using Google's Gemini API, the program generates metadata for each paper, allows users to manually edit the metadata, and finally stores it in a Supabase PostgreSQL database. The web application displays these papers in a separate tab. The web application uses the [shadcnui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library on the frontend for a fluent, responsive user experience. It is currently in the development stage and has not yet been deployed on the cloud.

## Future work

Currently, work is underway to make the web app more mobile-friendly and add an authentication step.
